          I believe that art and music play a crucial role in all cultures.
          Music can help nudge someone, either down the right or wrong path. It
          is very powerful and that's why I don't take my role as an artist
          lightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strive to create <em>generative</em> music. Music that regenerates
          you by taking you through an emotional journey or by evoking better
          thoughts and ideas. My hope is that my music can help elevate your
          life. So if my music doesn't do that for you, you should look
          elsewhere. I don't have the answers, just my perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          I see the importance of positive, once-in-a-lifetime experiences.
          Experiences that change your life for the better. I want to help
          create those kinds of experiences for myself and other people through
          music. That's why I see the importance of improvised
          <em>live acts</em>, which are created in its very moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          By sharing my vision of the good through music, I hope to make our
          lives just a little better.

            My solo live act <strong>GenerativeGig</strong> is first and
            foremost for me. Putting together a new synth patch is where I get
            reinspired and recharge my creative energy for new performances and
            collaborations.

          I try to be as vulnerable as possible in every musical project I
          partake in. I believe this is what true art is, no bullshitting
          around. Being alone can sometimes make this easier for me. I hope to
          express something truly real, a feeling or perspective that comes from
          inside me or out of this world.

          Weird, beautiful and noisy. That is how I would describe our duo live
          act <strong>Primatsound</strong> in three words. At the core, we want
          to take you on a once-in-a-lifetime emotional and spiritual journey
          through sound.

            Alien Paul has a deep fascination for sound and synthesis, and
            brings most of the sharper sounds and melodies to our sessions. This
            is the perfect counterpart to my more round and washed out
            preference to sound design.

          The band <strong>Portal K09</strong> consists of me, Paul Jatzky and
          Juppheater. We want to take you on a journey into alternate realities
          and tell untold stories, perhaps of the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our music, however, isn't for the faint of heart. Be prepared to be
          taken aback by the deep cutting saxophone of Paul Jatzky and the noise
          rattling electric guitar of Juppheater. Oh, and me making beeps and
          boops whenever I can to complete the sound experience.
